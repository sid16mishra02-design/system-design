# Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is an architectural pattern that divides a system's actions into commands and queries. It was first described by [Greg Young](https://twitter.com/gregyoung).

In CQRS, a _command_ is an instruction, a directive to perform a specific task. It is an intention to change something and doesn't return a value, only an indication of success or failure. And, a _query_ is a request for information that doesn't change the system's state or cause any side effects.

The core principle of CQRS is the separation of commands and queries. They perform fundamentally different roles within a system, and separating them means that each can be optimized as needed, which distributed systems can really benefit from.

## CQRS with Event Sourcing

The CQRS pattern is often used along with the Event Sourcing pattern. CQRS-based systems use separate read and write data models, each tailored to relevant tasks and often located in physically separate stores.

When used with the Event Sourcing pattern, the store of events is the write model and is the official source of information. The read model of a CQRS-based system provides materialized views of the data, typically as highly denormalized views.

## Advantages

Let's discuss some advantages of CQRS:

- Allows independent scaling of read and write workloads.
- Easier scaling, optimizations, and architectural changes.
- Closer to business logic with loose coupling.
- The application can avoid complex joins when querying.
- Clear boundaries between the system behavior.

## Disadvantages

Below are some disadvantages of CQRS:

- More complex application design.
- Message failures or duplicate messages can occur.
- Dealing with eventual consistency is a challenge.
- Increased system maintenance efforts.

## Use cases

Here are some scenarios where CQRS will be helpful:

- The performance of data reads must be fine-tuned separately from the performance of data writes.
- The system is expected to evolve over time and might contain multiple versions of the model, or where business rules change regularly.
- Integration with other systems, especially in combination with event sourcing, where the temporal failure of one subsystem shouldn't affect the availability of the others.
- Better security to ensure that only the right domain entities are performing writes on the data.

## Make it concrete

### Different models for changing and reading

A create-order command updates the write model. An event updates a separate, customer-friendly order-list view. CQRS separates those responsibilities; it does not require event sourcing.

### Apply it

Optimize the read view for actual queries, such as recent orders by customer, instead of making every screen join the write model. Keep projection updates idempotent and monitor lag. After creating an order, show its confirmed identifier and a pending-view state rather than pretending the read view updated instantly.

Extra models add synchronization and recovery work; a simple CRUD application may not benefit.

**Check:** how would you rebuild a lost read view?
